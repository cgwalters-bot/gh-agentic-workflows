# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for setting up and managing the gh-agentic-workflows pipeline.

## rollout-org.js

`rollout-org.js` surveys or pilots the pipeline across an organization. It defaults to
`bootc-dev` and source `bootc-dev/gh-agentic-workflows`, but requires an exact release
tag: `node scripts/rollout-org.js --version vX.Y.Z`. Plans first validate that this is a
published GitHub release, then remain read-only: they do not clone, write, push, or create
PRs. Plans report matching open rollout PRs and rollout branches that exist without a PR
instead of proposing duplicate work. Use `--json` for machine-readable results.

Apply is intentionally harder to invoke: use either a repeatable target
`--repo ORG/REPO` or explicit fleet-wide `--all`, together with `--apply --confirm-org ORG`.
For example: `node scripts/rollout-org.js --org bootc-dev --version vX.Y.Z --repo bootc-dev/example --apply --confirm-org bootc-dev`.
For the selected organization, `--repo example` is equivalent to `--repo ORG/example`;
repositories owned by another organization are rejected.
The script skips archived, fork, template, empty, metadata, sandbox, and source-package
repositories.
Package-managed support files outside `.github/workflows` (including `.github/aw`, skills,
agents, attributes, and any package-provided editor files) are reviewed and committed with
the workflow installation. Rollout commits are signed off using the invoking user's Git
identity so that repositories enforcing the Developer Certificate of Origin accept them.

If an earlier invocation opened rollout PRs without signoffs, rerun the same apply command
with `--repair-signoffs`. The script only rewrites an open PR when it is the expected
same-repository rollout branch, contains exactly one commit, and that commit's message is
unchanged from the tool-generated message. The push uses an exact force-with-lease check.
Repair mode never creates a branch or PR where one does not already exist.
For example: `node scripts/rollout-org.js --org bootc-dev --version vX.Y.Z --all
--apply --confirm-org bootc-dev --repair-signoffs`.
This follows the official gh-aw at-scale sharing guide: keep the package centrally in
`aw.yml`, pin consumers to an exact release tag, and install with `gh aw add
SOURCE@VERSION`. A repository containing all six package workflows is `update-planned`
in a read-only plan. In apply mode, stable gh-aw cannot select an exact new package tag
with `gh aw update` (and package-aware URL update is not stable), so the current safe
workaround is `gh aw add SOURCE@VERSION --force`, followed by an explicit compile and a
draft PR. Switch to package-aware `gh aw update` when it is stable and can target an
exact package version.

First installs use branch `agent-pipeline-rollout` and do not pass `--force`; they are
reported as `planned` and `opened`. Updates use the versioned branch
`agent-pipeline-update-vX.Y.Z` and are reported as `update-planned` and `update-opened`.
Existing operation PRs are reported with their URL; an operation branch without an open
PR is blocked instead. A forced update is an overwrite, not a three-way merge: package
file customizations can be replaced and stale package files can remain. The draft PR
must review both before merge. The script fails closed if the pre-update `merge.yml`
does not have the exact known normal auto-merge condition or exact known pilot guard;
it preserves either state and reapplies the drafter/fixer ecosystem network policy after
the refresh. It also removes accidental single trailing spaces from the package Markdown;
the final staged diff check still rejects all remaining whitespace errors.

Prerequisites are authenticated `gh`, the `gh-aw` extension (including a version capable
of compiling the selected release), git push permission, and permission to create draft
PRs. Pilot PRs retain `merge.yml` but disable auto-merge. Rust, Go, and Python targets get
the known-template package-network allowance; other languages are reported for manual review.
After merge, a human must install/configure the GitHub App credentials (`GH_AW_APP_CLIENT_ID`,
`GH_AW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `GH_AW_APP_BOT_SLUG`) and run the label setup before enabling
auto-merge. Do not put credentials on the command line.

## install-labels.js

Installs the required labels on a repository for the issue → PR → review → fix → merge pipeline.

### Labels Created

The script creates or updates the following labels:

- **`agent/code`** (green) — Triggers the drafter agent. When applied to an issue, the drafter agent reads the issue, implements the change, validates it, and opens a pull request.

- **`agent/fixme`** (red) — Applied by the review workflow when a PR needs work. The fix workflow consumes this label, reads the reviewer's feedback, and pushes a fix commit.

- **`agent/lgtm`** (green) — Applied by the review workflow when a PR is approved and ready to merge. The merge workflow automatically merges PRs with this label.

- **`agent/drafter-working`**, **`agent/review-working`**, **`agent/fix-working`** (yellow) — Indicates that the corresponding agent (drafter, review, or fix) is actively working on the issue or PR. Per-workflow labels avoid one workflow's cleanup clearing another's still-in-progress signal on the same PR.

- **`agent/workflow-edits-allowed`** (purple) — Pre-authorizes an agent run to edit protected files (workflows, README, etc.) without triggering the request_review gate. Apply this to an issue before labeling it `agent/code`, or to a PR before applying `agent/fixme`.

### Usage

#### Via GitHub Actions

The easiest way to install labels is using the included workflow. It also runs weekly on
its own (the create-or-update loop is idempotent, so this just self-heals any label
that gets renamed, deleted, or recolored by hand) — running it manually is only needed
to create the labels immediately instead of waiting for the first scheduled run:

1. Go to your repository's **Actions** tab
2. Select the **Install Labels** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**

Alternatively, you can copy `.github/workflows/install-labels.yml` to your own repository and run it there. That
workflow inlines the LABELS array and install loop directly in its `actions/github-script` step, so it has no
dependency on this file being checked out.

#### Via github-script action

If you want to integrate label installation into your own workflow, `install-labels.js` is a plain CommonJS module
you can `require()` after checking out the repo:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Install gh-agentic-workflows labels
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      const { installLabels } = require('./scripts/install-labels.js');
      await installLabels(github, context);
```

#### Via GitHub CLI

You can also use the GitHub CLI to create the labels directly:

```bash
gh label create "agent/code" --color 0E8A16 \
  --description "Triggers the drafter agent"

gh label create "agent/fixme" --color D93F0B \
  --description "Reviewer agent found issues that need fixing"

gh label create "agent/lgtm" --color 0E8A16 \
  --description "Reviewer agent approved; ready to auto-merge"

gh label create "agent/drafter-working" --color FBCA04 \
  --description "The drafter agent is actively working on this issue"

gh label create "agent/review-working" --color FBCA04 \
  --description "The review agent is actively working on this PR"

gh label create "agent/fix-working" --color FBCA04 \
  --description "The fix agent is actively working on this PR"

gh label create "agent/workflow-edits-allowed" --color 5319E7 \
  --description "Pre-authorizes agent runs to edit protected files without the request_review gate"
```

Or via `gh api`, e.g. to update an existing label:

```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/labels/agent/code -X PATCH \
  -f color="0E8A16" -f description="Triggers the drafter agent"
```

### Customizing Labels

To customize the labels (change colors, descriptions, or add new ones), edit the `LABELS` array in
`install-labels.js` **and** the matching copy in `.github/workflows/install-labels.yml`, then rerun the
installation workflow to update the labels on your repository.
